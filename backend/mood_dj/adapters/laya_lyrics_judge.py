"""LyricsJudge adapter backed by the real Laya Router, forced to the multilingual checkpoint.

The user's music is mostly Spanish, and the English checkpoint collapses off-English
(see `laya/router.py`'s module docstring: it scores near random-guessing on non-English
languages while reporting high confidence). The multilingual checkpoint (mmBERT-base,
322M params, 1024 tokens, 100+ languages per the model card) is selected explicitly with
`model="multilingual"` on every call, instead of relying on the Router's automatic
script-based routing, so behavior does not silently change if English lyrics show up in
an otherwise Spanish playlist.

Question types (confirmed by reading the installed `laya` package source, same schema
already used in `laya_decision_engine.py`):

- "noul" (yes/no): answer holds `{"noul": <probability the statement is true>}`.
- "score": answer holds `{"score": <expected index as float>}` over an ordered criteria list.

`predict_batch` shares a single forward pass across requests with an identical question
schema (see `Router._question_schema`), so `judge_lyrics` builds one schema for tone+fit
and reuses it across every track in the batch.
